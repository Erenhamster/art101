					<h2><strong>Summary of Efforts</strong></h2>
					<p>We worked together over zoom and text for this lab to accommodate health and schedules. We felt like we sort of understood the concepts of the HTML, but found the CSS to be a bit difficult. We understood the 'rules' of CSS and were able to complete the expected lab elements using it. It was cool to stylize our websites beyond just plain text! Overall it was great to experience working with the actual coding language.</p>
