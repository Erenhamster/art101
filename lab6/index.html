			<h1>Lab 6: arrays & objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>A challenge that came up was trying to figure out what the function meant and how to use it correctly as it wasn't taught in lecture yet </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that arose is the console log coming out as undefined. I was able to figure it out with the help of my partner, we both realized that I was missing a few variables and added extra words/characters</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I did the assignment with the feeling of uncertainty because I felt like we needed to do more than before. But in the end, I felt confident because majority of it is doing the same process like the last lab just with more functions - with the help of my partner we were able to finish it confidently. (Well the best we could...)  </p>
