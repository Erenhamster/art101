                    <p>What was wrong and how you fixed it?</p>
					<p>What was wrong was that whenever I pressed the challenge button, the special appeared and worked only towards that button. When I did the same for the other options like Results and Problems, nothing showed up. The way I fixed it is by making each of the buttons had their own functions since it seems like the button function was only calling the challenge button. In the end I was able to troubleshoot and figure it out with the use of my learned/background knowledge.</p>
